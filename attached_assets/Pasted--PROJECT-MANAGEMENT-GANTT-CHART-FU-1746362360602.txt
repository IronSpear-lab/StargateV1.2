üìÅ PROJECT MANAGEMENT & GANTT CHART FUNCTIONALITY (Inspired by OpenProject)
============================================================

1. PROJECT CREATION & STRUCTURE
------------------------------------------------------------
- [ ] Allow Project Leaders / Admins to:
      ‚Ä¢ Create new projects
      ‚Ä¢ Set project name, description
      ‚Ä¢ Define start & end dates
      ‚Ä¢ Add project members
      ‚Ä¢ Assign roles & permissions per member

- [ ] Each project includes:
      ‚Ä¢ Tasks
      ‚Ä¢ Files & folders
      ‚Ä¢ Wiki documentation
      ‚Ä¢ Time reports
      ‚Ä¢ Project-specific dashboard
      ‚Ä¢ Gantt chart view
      ‚Ä¢ Kanban board

2. GANTT CHART FUNCTIONALITY
------------------------------------------------------------
Goal: Provide full visual project timeline view with interactivity

- [ ] Timeline view with:
      ‚Ä¢ Tasks as horizontal bars
      ‚Ä¢ Start & End dates displayed visually
      ‚Ä¢ Color-coded by status (To Do / In Progress / Done)

- [ ] Interactions:
      ‚Ä¢ Drag to change task duration
      ‚Ä¢ Click to open/edit task
      ‚Ä¢ Double-click to create new task
      ‚Ä¢ Set task dependencies (links between tasks)

- [ ] Usability:
      ‚Ä¢ Zoom in/out (daily, weekly, monthly views)
      ‚Ä¢ Tooltip on hover: show task name, assignee, status
      ‚Ä¢ Responsive layout
      ‚Ä¢ Syncs with Kanban/task list in real time

3. REQUIREMENT FOR DEVIN
------------------------------------------------------------
Please implement the following based on the above:

‚úî Full project creation system with timeline metadata  
‚úî Interactive Gantt chart with linked task system  
‚úî Dependency support between tasks  
‚úî Sync between Gantt, Kanban, and Dashboard views  
‚úî Real-time updates when dates/statuses change
