I want you to help me build a full-featured project management platform, inspired by OpenProject, using React (frontend) and Django (backend). The platform must support the following core features, and I want you to build them one by one, as separate components or modules:

ðŸ”· 1. Project Management
Create, edit, delete projects

Show a project dashboard with description and key stats

Support subprojects (hierarchy)

Color-coded status for each project

ðŸ”· 2. Work Packages / Task Management
Create/edit/delete tasks (called work packages)

Assign tasks to users

Set due dates, priorities, status

Track dependencies between tasks

Allow comments on each task

Allow attachments (uploading files to a task)

Log time worked on a task

Support custom fields per task

ðŸ”· 3. Gantt Chart View
Display all tasks visually on a timeline

Draw dependency arrows between tasks

Allow drag and drop to change task dates

Display milestones

Update tasks when changes are made on the chart

ðŸ”· 4. Wiki Module
Each project has a wiki section

Markdown editor and preview

Version history and rollback

Internal page linking

ðŸ”· 5. Calendar
Show deadlines and milestones

Show assigned tasks on a calendar view

ðŸ”· 6. Document Module
Upload/download documents to a project

Organize files into folders

Comment on files

Version control (keep older versions)

ðŸ”· 7. Agile Boards
Basic Kanban board for each project

Tasks shown as cards in columns (To Do, In Progress, Done)

Drag and drop support

ðŸ”· 8. User Management
Register/login with 2FA support

Assign roles and permissions (admin, manager, developer)

Each user has a profile page

ðŸ”· 9. Notifications
Email or in-app notifications on task assignment or changes

ðŸ”· 10. REST API
Provide REST API for all project/task/wiki features

Secure endpoints with token authentication

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack Requirements:
Frontend: React with TypeScript, using MUI (Joy UI), or similar

Backend: Django with Django REST Framework

Database: SQLite for dev, PostgreSQL for production

Gantt Library: Use frappe-gantt or any React-compatible Gantt library

Optional: Docker support, OpenAPI docs, GitHub integration

Start by scaffolding the backend project with Django, define the basic models (Project, Task, User, WikiPage, Document), and set up the REST API. Then create the frontend layout and progressively implement each module as listed.
